## Python Dependencies
This repo uses python3. The code depends on the following libraries:
- numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib
- opendssdirect, which you can [install with pip](http://dss-extensions.org/OpenDSSDirect.py/notebooks/Installation.html#With-pip)

TODO: Make a script that will install these dependencies into a python virtual environment
